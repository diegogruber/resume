    "summary": "From ideation to prototyping and continuous delivery, I've helped to design and develop systems that automate and improve decisions at some of the most important companies in the world with the use of big data and artificial intelligence. \n\nIn 2013 I co-founded Kernel Analytics, a data science boutique in Barcelona, Spain. In the space of six years the company grew from ten to close to one-hundred employees and a second office in Madrid. Kernel Analytics was acquired by the Boston Consulting Group in 2019 and I have been with BCG since, first as a Lead Data Scientist and now as Product Management Director, building products that help our clients transform key activities by leveraging their data assets together with the latest in machine learning. \n\nI believe deep product knowledge is key to successful delivery and bridging the gap between business users and engineers. I love programming and software development. I prioritize building robust and scalable systems while adhering to software engineering best practices. \n\nI've managed several teams working in problems related to personalisation and marketing across a wide range of industries, including telco, utilities, retail, travel, and more.\n\nI hold a PhD in Economics from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). During my studies I developed a strong interest in Statistics, Econometrics, and predictive modelling. I also enjoy teaching and I've held data science workshops for students and professionals at places like the European Central Bank and the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics.",
