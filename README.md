# resume

Uses [`resumed`](https://github.com/rbardini/resumed) to generate HTML from a JSON file. To install run

```
npm install -g resumed jsonresume-theme-elegant jsonresume-theme-full
```

For updating, apply changes to `resume.json` and then run `update.sh`. This will create two versions:

- `index.html` which is rendered by Github Pages
- `resume.html` which is suitable for printing as PDF
